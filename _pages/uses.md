## Content here.

This page is a collection of tools and technologies I use in my daily life, both personally and professionally.

The concept is based on [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/), a site that showcases the tools and setups of various individuals.

## Software

* I've been a user of Windows since the days of Windows 95! Always been curious to try MacOS, but for one reason or another it just never happened.

### Editing and Development

* **Text Editor**: I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding and text editing.
* **Typeface**: I am a big fan of [Mono Lisa](https://monolisa.dev) (yes, a paid typeface!). I bought it in August 2022 and have not even contemplated changing since. I have two customised versions of it: one with ligatures for coding, and one without for the terminal.
* **Browser**: I use [Brave](https://www.brave.com) as my browser, mostly because it blocks 99% of the trackers and ad systems and generally makes the web speed up.
