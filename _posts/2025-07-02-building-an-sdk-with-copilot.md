I have been using Copilot for VS Code for a while now, just on a curious/ad-hoc basis.

There's a lot of hype (and anti-hype) going around, and I reasoned it would better to try and build something of reasonably scope and complexity and lean into the technology to see what it can do if you push it and configure it with decent settings, models and prompts etc.

Therefore I started to build an SDK for [Zoho Bigin](https://www.bigin.com/), if you're curious then the first part can be found below, all feedback welcome. ðŸ™‚
