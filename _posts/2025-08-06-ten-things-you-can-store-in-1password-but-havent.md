I have been a user of [1Password](https://1password.com) for over a year now, and life is calmer with *everything* in there. I recently thought that there's probably a lot of things that people have forgotten to add that are *not* passwords.

Here's my run down (in no particular order)â€¦

## Ten things you should store in 1Password

### 1. Passport

Yes, probably the most important document you might own. Get the number, issue/expiry date and any other key details added to your vault. While you're doing that, **add a photo of the back and front** as well. 1Password gives you 1GB of storage per personal account, and this is one of those occasions when you should use it.

Do you have children? Add their passports as well. ðŸ˜‰

### 2. Drivers License

It's close to the passport in ID-worthiness in most countries, so get that added as well. You might not have it in your wallet when the officer asks you for your details.

### 3. Bank details

You might have your bank details in your banking apps, but remember **1Password isn't just for you** â€“ it's for any nearest and dearest that might need to access your details in case of emergency, your incapacity or death. (Feels morbid, but hey, life is fatal in 100% of cases!)

Get the details in there - 1Password should always be your first place for finding your personal details and is the easiest way [to share them](https://support.1password.com/share-items/) - don't go copying the raw details into a text message.

### 4. National Insurance/Social Security number

I can remember mine, but in the UK it's tied to everything - pension, benefits etc. If the worst was to happen, someone else might need it.

### 5. Padlock combinations

A small quality of life improvement! Do you have a shed with a padlock? Suitcase that you use infrequently? Struggle to remember the combination when you don't use it often? Get your padlock numbers into 1Password.

### 6. WiFi password

This is super-useful when you have friends/family around, no need to reach for the card at the back of the router. Also if you're installing a new smart device it saves you from scurrying off to another room to find the details to connect it. Just open your phone and find the details.

### 7. Insurance documents

You hope you never need them, but I found it brings peace-of-mind to have your insurance documents in your vault. That includes your **home, contents, health, car, gadgets** etc.

> If you couldn't access your home, could you be sure you could access your documents?

For me, this means that in my vault I have the following:

1. Policy documents
2. Contact numbers: there could be multiple - some for claims, some for not having access to the home, others for legal cover
3. Expiry date for the policy

> If you ever need these details it will probably be at the point of highest stress, so just knowing the details are there will make it easier to recover.

### 8. SSH keys

If you're a developer then you probably use SSH keys for GitHub and accessing servers. 1Password is great at helping you [manage SSH keys](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/).

### 9. Key contacts

If you gave someone your [Emergency Kit](https://support.1password.com/emergency-kit/) would they know everyone they might need to contact? Have you added contacts for key people such as:

* Doctors, physicians
* Lawyer, solicitor
* Family members, friends that this person might not know.

## 10. Medical details

Self-explanatory hopefully, but if you have a long medical history or specific conditions, having these details in a form that someone with your **Emergency Kit** can access and share with an appropriate medical professional could literally be a life saver if abroad and the worst happens.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this gives you a good checklist of some of the truly useful things you can add to 1Password. Most you might never need to accessâ€¦ **but if you did** you have the peace of mind that you know where you (or someone else) can find them.
